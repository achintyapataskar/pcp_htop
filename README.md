# pcp_htop
This is the version of htop command line tool which uses Performance Co-Pilot's PMAPI under the hood to gather data.
# Usage
This program will work just like the htop command works regularly.

It needs to be compiled from source to link pcp libraries.

I have added detailed instructions for the same in the wiki page
